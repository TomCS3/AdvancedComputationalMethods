"""Plotfile.py: small utility to support SESG6025.

Usage:

python plotfile.py FILENAME

expects data in the ascii data file FILENAME, organised in row and columns, and
attempts to plot column 2 against column 1 if there are two columns, or
attempts to plot columns 2 to n against column 1 if there are n columns (n>2)
